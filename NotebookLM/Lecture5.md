## 1. In the context of cloud resource management, what is the primary function of a Unified Manager?
- To provide a single management interface for configuring and provisioning resources across different infrastructure components for applications and services. ✅

## 2. A cloud provider offers 'Gold', 'Silver', and 'Bronze' storage tiers with different drive types, RAID levels, and costs. Which phase of resource provisioning using a Unified Manager is this an example of?
- Resource pool management ✅

## 3. What is the fundamental principle of the software-defined approach to managing IT infrastructure?
- Separating the management functions from the infrastructure components into external software ✅

## 4. A service instance is guaranteed a minimum of 4 GB of RAM but is prevented from using more than 16 GB. Which resource allocation model does this represent?
- Absolute resource allocation ✅

## 5. Which compute resource management technique relies on an agent within the guest OS to communicate with the hypervisor and relinquish unused memory pages during periods of scarcity?
- Dynamic memory allocation ✅

## 6. What is the primary goal of the 'Storage Pool Rebalancing' technique?
- To restripe and spread data across all drives in a pool after new drives are added. ✅

## 7. How does the 'Traffic Shaping' technique manage network congestion?
- By queuing excess packets for later transmission when the traffic rate exceeds a certain pre-configured limit. ✅

## 8. Which Quality of Service (QoS) approach requires an application to signal its needs to the network and wait for confirmation before transmitting data?
- Integrated services ✅

Justification: (From my notes) The application signals the network to inform network components about the required QoS. This is like a deadline. The application can transmit data through the network only after receiving confirmation from the network.

## 9. What is the primary benefit of 'Memory Page Sharing' in a virtualized environment?
- Allows for a greater degree of memory over-commitment by eliminating redundant copies of memory pages ✅

## 10. A storage administrator needs to reclaim space from thin LUNs that was previously used by a file system but is now free. The file system's API can communicate the locations of this unused space to the storage system. Which space reclamation method would be used?
- API-based reclamation ✅

## 11. Which technology combines multiple physical links between two switches or between a switch and a node into a single logical link to distribute traffic and increase bandwidth?
- Link aggregation ✅

Justification: (from my notes) Combines links between 2 switches, and between a switch and a node. Enables distribution of network traffic across links in the aggregation.
