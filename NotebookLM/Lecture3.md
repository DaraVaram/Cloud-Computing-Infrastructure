## 1. A cloud provider is designing a compute system with a focus on maximizing processing density and scalability within a single enclosure that provides shared power and cooling. Which type of compute system best fits these requirements?
- Blade ✅

Look at the key words: maximizing density, scalability in a single enclosure, shared power and cooling (through blade chasis)

## 2. A storage administrator needs to protect data using a RAID technique that writes a calculated data protection block on a different disk for each stripe of data. This allows for data reconstruction if one disk fails. Which RAID technique is being described?
- Parity ✅

## 3. Which component in a compute system is a volatile storage device that holds the programs currently being executed and the data being used by the processor?
- RAM ✅

## 4. A company wants to implement a Storage Area Network (SAN) by leveraging its existing high-speed IP network infrastructure and needs to transport block-level storage data. Which protocol is designed to carry SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network for this purpose?
- iSCSI ✅

## 5. In a Fibre Channel SAN fabric, which identifier is assigned dynamically by a switch to an adapter port to enable communication and routing?
- FC Address ✅

## 6. What is the key advantage of a scale-out NAS deployment compared to a traditional (scale-up) NAS deployment?
- Performance and capacity are scaled by adding nodes to a cluster

## 7. A system requires storage that provides the protection of RAID 5 but can also withstand the failure of two simultaneous disk drives. Which RAID level should be implemented?
- RAID 6 ✅

Because of dual parity. 

## 8. What is the primary function of a Converged Network Adapter (CNA) in an FCoE SAN environment?
- Provides functionality of both NIC and FC HBA (host bus adapter) in a single device ✅

Directly from my notes

## 9. Which storage system architecture presents storage to a compute system as if it were a local drive, on which the compute system must then create its own file system?
- Block-based storage ✅

The key idea here is as if it were a local drive, and the fact that the compute system needs to create its own file system on it

## 10. The protocol FCIP is widely used for disaster recovery solutions. What is its core function in this context?
- It encapsulates FC frames into IP packets to transport them between geographically separate FC SANs ✅

Again, directly from the notes. The key word here is encapsulates. 

## 11. What distinguishes an object-based storage system from a file-based storage system regarding its data organization?
- Object-based storage uses a flat, non-hierarchical address space. ✅

## 12. In the context of the physical layer of cloud computing, what is the primary role of a compute system?
- To execute the software of providers and consumers ✅

## 13. Which RAID technique improves storage system performance by spreading data across multiple drives so they can be used in parallel, but offers no data protection on its own?
- RAID 0 (Striping) ✅

## 14. A key driver for adopting IP SAN is the ability to use mature security options available for IP networks. Which of the following is an IP SAN protocol?
- iSCSI ✅

What are all of the IP SAN protocols? FCIP and iSCSI

## 15. What is a defining characteristic of a blade compute system compared to a rack-mounted system?
- Multiple servers are housed in a chasis with integrated, shared power, networking and cooling. ✅

## 16. In a FCoE SAN, what component is responsible for encapsulating FC frames into Ethernet frames and decapsulating them?
- FCF (Forwarder) ✅

## 17. Which of these storage devices is characterized by very low latency, low power requirements, and storing data on semiconductor-based memory?
- SSD ✅

Semi-conductor mentioned. 

## 18. A provider offers consumers compute systems that are shared among multiple tenants. What is this hosting model called?
- Shared hosting ✅

Because it's not dedicated. 

## 19. What is the primary purpose of using the 'mirroring' technique in a RAID configuration?
- To store the same data simultaneously on two different drives ✅

## 20. Compute-to-compute communication within a data center, interconnecting physical compute systems, typically uses which type of protocol?
- IP-based protocols ✅

This is in my notes. Compute-to-compute use IP-based communication. 

## 21. Which component on a motherboard is a collection of microchips responsible for managing specific functions, such as processor access to RAM and peripheral ports?
- Chipset ✅

## 22. The three common storage system architectures are based on what fundamental characteristic?
- The data access methods ✅

## 23. What is the primary benefit of a FCoE SAN as described in the source material?
- Reduces the number of adapters, cables, and switches by consolidating traffic types ✅

The key word here is consolidating.

## 24. Which RAID level is described as a 'striped set with no fault tolerance'?
- RAID 0 ✅

## 25. A storage controller, which integrates the front-end, cache, and back-end on a single board, is a key component in which type of storage system?
- Block-based storage system ✅

## 26. What is a primary purpose of a network in the physical layer of a cloud computing reference model, beyond connecting compute and storage systems within a data center?
- To connect multiple data centers or multiple clouds to one another. ✅
