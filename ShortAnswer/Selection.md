## 1. List the Cloud Computing Service Models. Describe only one of them

The Cloud service models are: 
1. PaaS (Platform as a service): The consumers' resources are just the platform. Cannot manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, OS, or storage. Basically, you can only create your own applications on the cloud and deploy them, nothing else. 
2. SaaS (Software as a service) The provider provides everything. The consumer can only **use** the cloud to run their own applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities. You can only access the apps that are provided. Like Gmail.
3. IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications. Computational resources are provided to the consumers. You have the freedom to do whatever you want (there's some limits to this, like virtualization in a system)

## 2. List the five cloud computing characteristics discussed in class. Describe only one.

1. On-demand self-service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. No human interaction between provider and consumer. 
2. Rapid elasticity: Elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically. 
3. Resource pooling: Multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
4. Broad network access: Can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, regardless of the compute power of your device. 
5. Measured service: Billing. Basically, pay as you go. Automatically control and optimize resources by leveraging a metering capability.

## 3. List the cloud computing deployment models. Describe only one.

1. Public: Basically, anyone can access the cloud. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc... through Azure or AWS are all part of the public cloud. 
2. Private: On-premise or external, only for the specific organization, the access levels are managed within the private cloud itself. Exclusive access. 
3. Community: Cloud that's shared between consumers that have a similar goal. Private for a group of entities only, like a chain of hospitals, or governmental entities. 
4. Hybrid: The idea of having something private and then extending to off-site during peak hours.


## 4. What are the cloud computing characteristics that are provided by virtualization? Describe how the virtualization layer delivers on those characteristics.

1. Rapid Elasticity
2. Resource Pooling

## 5. Describe the NAS deployment options.

1. Traditional NAS (Scale-up): Capacity and performance of a single system is scaled by upgrading or adding more NAS components
2. Scale-out NAS: We add additional nodes to the cluster. Multiple NAS modules that act as if they're one.
